## Roadmap
The internationalization part of the project requires refinement, especially in adapting the calendar and date to different ethnicities. Redesigning certain components using a more customizable UI library, such as Ant Design, is a priority due to limitations with Syncfusion and Tremor.

Collaborating with other developers, there is ongoing work to create a full-fledged software that can be used in various schools, with plans to open source that project soon.

## Credits
The basic UI design is inspired by a template from FloatUI.
